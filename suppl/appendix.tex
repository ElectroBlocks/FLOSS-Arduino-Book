\chapter{About the Shield}\label{shield-appendix}
As discussed in \secref{shield-hw}, the shield is a printed circuit board (PCB) with a large number of sensors, already
wired and hence, ready to use. The shield provides the user a faster way of circuit prototyping without worrying
much about troubleshooting. In this chapter, we will share the details on how to purchase the shield.  As of now, we have identified two locations from which one can buy the shield:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Aditya Enterprises \\
          Plot no. F-16, Rathi Sansar, Pisadevi Road \\ Aurangabad - 431001, Maharashtra. \\
          Email: admin@adityaentr.com $||$
          Contact: +91-9822094359
    \item FOSSEE IIT Bombay \\
          Mumbai - 400076, Maharashtra. \\
          Email: info@fossee.in $||$
          Contact: +91-22-25764133
\end{enumerate}
We are looking for partners who can help us in the manufacturing and distribution of the shield. Those who are interested may contact us at info@fossee.in

Even though the shield obviates the need for a breadboard as an intermediate tool for electronics circuit prototyping, some learners might prefer to use a breadboard and other required sensors to design their circuits. That's why we have added breadboard connection diagrams in the book, wherever required.Â Those who wish to buy the components used in those diagrams may contact:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Aditya Enterprises \\
          Plot no. F-16, Rathi Sansar, Pisadevi Road \\ Aurangabad - 431001, Maharashtra. \\
          Email: admin@adityaentr.com $||$
          Contact: +91-9822094359
\end{enumerate}
One can also buy those components from the E-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, etc.
