# FLOSS-Arduino-Book
[Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/), [Xcos](https://www.scilab.org/software/xcos), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and [OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org/) are powerful and free. However, there has not been much literature that teaches how to use them to program the versatile [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno). To address this gap, we have written this series of books. We have provided code written in all of these open-source software. The reader is recommended to go through the book that covers a particular software. For the sake of convenience, we call each of the tools (**Scilab**, **Xcos**, **Python**, **Julia**, and **OpenModelica**) as **FLOSS** in these books. To know more about **FLOSS**, one may want to visit [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in/).Â 

The books are as given below:
* [Microcontroller programming with Arduino, Scilab, and Xcos](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FLOSS-Arduino-Book/blob/master/scilab.pdf)
* [Microcontroller programming with Arduino and Julia](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FLOSS-Arduino-Book/blob/master/julia.pdf)
* [Microcontroller programming with Arduino and OpenModelica](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FLOSS-Arduino-Book/blob/master/OpenModelica.pdf)
* [Microcontroller programming with Arduino and Python](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FLOSS-Arduino-Book/blob/master/python.pdf)

The consolidated book (which covers all the four FLOSSs mentioned above) is available at [FLOSS-Arduino](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FLOSS-Arduino-Book/blob/master/floss-arduino.pdf), and the code mentioned in the book are available at [Origin](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FLOSS-Arduino-Book/tree/master/Origin). 


## Source files to compile the book 
The books have been prepared using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). The main LaTeX file is available [here](https://github.com/FOSSEE/FLOSS-Arduino-Book/blob/master/floss-arduino.tex). While compiling, one needs to modify the two paths (`Home` and `Origin`), as mentioned at the top of this file. 


## Reporting an issue 
Any issues faced while executing the code for running the experiments can be reported by opening a `New issue` in the repository. However, the readers are recommended to glance at the existing issues to check whether their issues have alraedy been reported / addressed.
